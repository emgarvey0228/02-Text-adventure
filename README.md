# 02-Text-adventure
This is an interactive text adventure game, written in Python, for my Game Technology class at Indiana University.

I did my very best to follow the step- by- step instructions created by my instructor on how to successfully write an interactive text adventure game. In this assignment, I decided to put my own twist on things by making the setting of the game located in one of your scary dreams!

To play: run main.py in Python. 

Good luck trying to get back into reality!
